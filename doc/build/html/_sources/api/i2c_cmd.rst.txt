i2c_cmd
~~~~~~~


This contains the API to do low-level interfacing with the i2c channel.
Run this script with interactive mode `-i` if running it as main.
This module contains all the methods that involve direct interaction
with the array itself, and it defines the ``PhasedArray`` and 
``ChannelBoard`` objects in order to do so.
